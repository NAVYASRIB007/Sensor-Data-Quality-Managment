# Sensor-Data-Quality-Managment
Data Quality Management (DQM) is the process of analyzing, defining, monitoring, and improving quality of data continuously. Few data quality dimensions widely used by the data practitioners are Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, and Validity. Various DQM rules are configured to apply DQM to the existing data. These DQM rules are applied to clean up, repair, and standardize incoming data & identify and correct invalid data.
The data is analysed for required values, validate data types, and detect integrity violation. DQM is applied to correct the data by providing default values, formatting numbers and dates, and removing missing values, null values, non-relevant values, duplicates, out of bounds, referential integrity violations, and value integrity violations.
